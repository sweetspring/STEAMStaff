# Call Volunteers
for the project Learn English word of the shape/color/number/fruits（***), I ever planned to extend it to the whole life circle and different parts/form of the plants(and animals), seed, seedling,sprout,flower,fruit,leaf, the part for cooking, after cooked, which can help the kids to learn the life secret and relationship between the nature and human beings.<br/>
It would need a lot of pictures from different locations, different seasons, need a long time to wait for the circle closed.<br/>
So if you would like to make it happen, please let me know if you can offer some funding,  provide some pictures for free, or volunteer the project coordinator.<br/>
I can be connected via email 2109125316(at)qq.com, please put the subject #Volunteers STEAM - Nature Cognition# in your email. Thanks ahead.
