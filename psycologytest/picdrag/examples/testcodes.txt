Each action reflects the priorities that you have set in your life.

For example if the first thing that you did was to answer the phone then your biggest priority in life would be your career and job. Similarly if the fourth thing that you did was to attend to the baby then your fourth priority would be your family.

Take a look at the following table to see which priority corresponds to which action.
